# SQL integrity constraints
SQL (Structured Query Language) provides various integrity constraints to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data stored in a relational database. These constraints help maintain data quality and prevent the entry of inconsistent or invalid data. Here are some common SQL integrity constraints:

1. **Primary Key Constraint:**
   - Ensures that a column (or a set of columns) uniquely identifies each record in a table. It prevents the entry of duplicate and null values in the specified columns.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       FirstName VARCHAR(50),
       LastName VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

2. **Unique Constraint:**
   - Ensures that values in a column (or a set of columns) are unique across all records in the table, except for null values.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Students (
       StudentID INT,
       Email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
       FirstName VARCHAR(50),
       LastName VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

3. **Foreign Key Constraint:**
   - Establishes a relationship between two tables by linking the value in a column of one table to the value in a unique key column of another table. It enforces referential integrity.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       ProductID INT,
       Quantity INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID)
   );
   ```

4. **Check Constraint:**
   - Specifies a condition that must be satisfied for a row to be entered or updated. It allows you to define business rules or restrictions on the values in a column.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       Salary DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (Salary > 0)
   );
   ```

5. **NOT NULL Constraint:**
   - Ensures that a column cannot contain null values, meaning every record must have a value for that column.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Customers (
       CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

6. **Default Constraint:**
   - Specifies a default value for a column. If a value is not provided during an INSERT operation, the default value is used.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Products (
       ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       ProductName VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'Untitled'
   );
   ```

These integrity constraints collectively help maintain the consistency and reliability of data within a relational database, ensuring that it adheres to the defined rules and relationships.

# Difference between Unique Key and Primary Key

Both the UNIQUE constraint and the PRIMARY KEY constraint in SQL are used to enforce uniqueness in a column or a set of columns, but they serve slightly different purposes:

1. **Primary Key Constraint:**
   - A primary key is a special type of unique constraint that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It is a combination of **NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints**. Every table should have a primary key, and the values in the primary key column(s) must be unique and not null.
   - There can be only one primary key in a table.
   - Primary key columns are often used as foreign keys in other tables to establish relationships.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Students (
       StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       FirstName VARCHAR(50),
       LastName VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

2. **Unique Constraint:**
   - The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column (or a set of columns) are unique across all records in the table. Unlike the primary key, a table can have multiple unique constraints.
   - Unique constraints can contain null values, except in the case of a composite unique constraint where all columns must be unique, and at least one column must be not null.
   - Unique constraints are useful when you want to ensure uniqueness but don't necessarily need the column(s) to be the primary identifier for each record.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmployeeID INT,
       Email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
       FirstName VARCHAR(50),
       LastName VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

In summary, the primary key is a specific case of a unique constraint that uniquely identifies each record in a table and is often used as a reference in other tables. The unique constraint, on the other hand, simply enforces uniqueness in a column or set of columns but doesn't necessarily imply that the column(s) uniquely identify each record in the table.

# Data Redundancy
Data redundancy refers to the duplication of data within a database system. It occurs when the same piece of information is stored in more than one place. While a certain level of redundancy may be inevitable or even necessary in some cases, excessive redundancy can lead to several issues. Here are some aspects of data redundancy:

1. **Storage Overhead:**
   - Redundant data takes up additional storage space. Storing the same information multiple times across a database can result in increased disk space usage.

2. **Data Inconsistency:**
   - Redundancy increases the risk of data inconsistency. If the same data is updated in one place but not in another, it can lead to conflicting or outdated information.

3. **Data Update Anomalies:**
   - Redundant data can lead to anomalies during data updates. There are three types of update anomalies: insertion anomalies (difficulty in adding new data), deletion anomalies (loss of data unintentionally when deleting), and modification anomalies (inconsistency when updating data).

4. **Increased Maintenance Complexity:**
   - Managing redundant data requires more effort and increases the complexity of database maintenance. Updates, inserts, and deletes need to be carefully coordinated to ensure data consistency.

5. **Wasted Resources:**
   - Redundant data can result in wasted resources during data retrieval and manipulation. Unnecessary duplication of data means more processing time and increased I/O operations.

6. **Normalization to Reduce Redundancy:**
   - Database normalization is a process that aims to reduce redundancy by organizing data into well-structured tables. Normalization involves decomposing large tables into smaller, related tables to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.

Example of Redundancy:

Consider a database with information about students and their courses. A table might store both student information and the courses they are enrolled in, leading to redundancy if a student is enrolled in multiple courses. Normalization would involve breaking this into separate tables for students and courses, linked by a unique identifier.

```sql
-- Redundant Data (Not Normalized)
CREATE TABLE StudentCourses (
    StudentID INT,
    StudentName VARCHAR(50),
    CourseID INT,
    CourseName VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Normalized Data
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Courses (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)
);
```

By normalizing the data, redundancy is reduced, and data integrity is improved. Normalization also helps in avoiding update anomalies and makes the database more efficient.

# Data Anomalies
Data anomalies are inconsistencies or problems that can occur in a database due to issues such as poor database design, lack of normalization, or incomplete transactions. There are three main types of data anomalies:

1. **Insertion Anomalies:**
   - Insertion anomalies occur when it is not possible to add certain information to the database without the presence of other, as yet unknown, information. This can happen in non-normalized databases where certain attributes can only be determined after a record is inserted.

   **Example:**
   Consider a database table where customer information is stored along with orders. If a new customer places an order, and we don't have any information about that customer yet, we may face an insertion anomaly.

   ```sql
   -- Non-normalized table
   CREATE TABLE CustomerOrders (
       CustomerID INT,
       CustomerName VARCHAR(50),
       OrderID INT,
       ProductName VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

   In this case, you can't insert an order for a new customer without creating a record for that customer, even if you don't have all the customer details yet.

2. **Deletion Anomalies:**
   - Deletion anomalies occur when removing data unintentionally leads to the loss of other, unrelated data. This is often a problem in non-normalized databases where information is duplicated across multiple records.

   **Example:**
   Continuing with the previous example, if a customer with no current orders is deleted from the table, we lose information about that customer altogether.

   ```sql
   -- Non-normalized table
   CREATE TABLE CustomerOrders (
       CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       CustomerName VARCHAR(50),
       OrderID INT,
       ProductName VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

   Deleting a customer also removes any information about orders associated with that customer.

3. **Update Anomalies:**
   - Update anomalies occur when updating data leads to inconsistencies. This can happen when the same data is represented in multiple places and is not updated consistently.

   **Example:**
   Suppose we have a database that stores employee information, including the department they work in. If an employee changes their department, updating all occurrences of that employee's information becomes necessary to maintain consistency.

   ```sql
   -- Non-normalized table
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       EmployeeName VARCHAR(50),
       Department VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

   Updating the department for an employee in one record while leaving other records unchanged could lead to an inconsistency.

To address these anomalies, proper database design, including normalization and the use of foreign keys, is crucial. Normalization helps in organizing data to reduce redundancy and dependencies, and foreign keys help establish relationships between tables, preventing these anomalies.

# DBMS over "file based system"
Database Management Systems (DBMS) offer several advantages over traditional file-based systems. Here are some key advantages:

1. **Data Integrity and Accuracy:**
   - DBMS enforces data integrity constraints, such as unique keys, foreign keys, and check constraints, to ensure data accuracy and consistency. This helps in maintaining the quality of data.

2. **Data Independence:**
   - DBMS provides a level of abstraction between the logical structure of data and its physical storage. This means that changes in the database structure do not affect the application programs, achieving a higher degree of data independence.

3. **Data Security:**
   - DBMS provides security features like user authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect sensitive data. Access controls can be implemented at various levels to restrict unauthorized access.

4. **Concurrent Access and Transaction Management:**
   - DBMS supports concurrent access to the database by multiple users. It ensures that transactions are executed in a way that maintains the consistency of the database, using techniques like locking and transaction isolation.

5. **Data Redundancy Reduction:**
   - Unlike file-based systems where data redundancy is common, DBMS helps in reducing redundancy by normalizing the data. This not only saves storage space but also avoids inconsistencies that may arise from redundant data.

6. **Data Retrieval and Query Optimization:**
   - DBMS provides powerful query languages (e.g., SQL) and optimization techniques to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently. This allows users to perform complex queries and analyses on the data stored in the database.

7. **Scalability:**
   - DBMS can handle large amounts of data and is scalable. As data volume increases, the performance of the system can be maintained or improved through various optimization techniques and scalability features.

8. **Data Relationships:**
   - DBMS supports the establishment of relationships between different tables through foreign keys. This enables the representation of complex relationships in the data, making it easier to model and manage.

9. **Data Maintenance and Centralized Control:**
   - DBMS provides centralized control over the data, making it easier to manage and maintain. Changes to the data or its structure can be controlled centrally, reducing the likelihood of errors.

10. **Backup and Recovery:**
    - DBMS offers features for data backup and recovery, ensuring that data can be restored to a consistent state in the event of hardware failures, data corruption, or other issues.

11. **Data Modeling and Flexibility:**
    - DBMS allows for the use of data models that provide a structured way to represent and organize data. This makes it easier to understand and design the structure of the data, promoting better data modeling and flexibility.

In summary, DBMS provides a more efficient and structured approach to data management compared to traditional file-based systems. It addresses issues related to data integrity, security, and redundancy while offering features for efficient data retrieval, maintenance, and scalability.
